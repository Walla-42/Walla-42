- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Walla-42
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in bioinformatics and data analytics 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, SQLite, and Docker
- My current projects include a pipeline for analyzing large genomes for specific genes and analyzing the variation between specific populations of people. This repository is private until I get to a point where my code generates data. Stay tuned!
